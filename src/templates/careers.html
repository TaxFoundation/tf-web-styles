        <h2>Who We Are</h2>
        <p>We’re a 78-year-old nonpartisan, non-profit think tank located steps away from the White House in Washington, DC. Our staff brings a balance of time-earned experience and youthful ambition to the table, and we regularly work with policymakers on both sides of the aisle to help fix problems in national and state tax codes.</p>
        <p>By focusing on effective policies instead of politics, we have curated a reputation as one of the most effective policy think tanks in the nation.</p>

        <h2>What We Do</h2>
        <p>Recently, we’ve analyzed the tax plans of every presidential candidate, bringing their proposals to the national spotlight and ensuring that the politicians and media are informed and honest.</p>
        <p> At the state level, we use our research to foster competition between the states and advise policymakers on how to improve their tax systems.</p>
        <p> In 2015, our work was cited in 22,193 news articles in 4,304 different publications, including all 100 of the largest national outlets and the papers of record in all fifty states. We produced 73 publications, including 11 books, posted 502 blog posts, and our website got a record 8.5 million views.</p>

        <h2>What We Offer</h2>
        <p>Lorem ipsum about how we care about our employees. Below might also include sections on the great location we have, our excellent office culture, and/or the great career advancement opportunities we bring to the table.</p>

          <h3>Time Off</h3>

          <h3>401(k)</h3>
          <p>The Tax Foundation offers a generous 401(k) retirement plan. We match 100% on your first 3% of contributions and 50% on your next 2% of contributions.</p>
